I'm sharing some free LinkedIn Premium (https://lnkd.in/eDfSXvUF) subscriptions with my network - specifically people in the recruiting space who are looking for work (it's tough out there, y'all). LinkedIn Premium comes with a ton of advanced features to help you land your next job, including LinkedIn Learning, where you can brush up on all things AI, learn how to improve your profile, and even practice interview prep.

If you:
1. Work in the Recruiting space
AND
2. Are not currently subscribed to LinkedIn Premium
AND
3. Are actively looking for work"
