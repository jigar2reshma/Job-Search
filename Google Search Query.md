here's a generic document that anyone can use as a template for their job search, with clear instructions on how to plug in their specific job roles and desired websites.
Personalized Remote Job Search Query & Automation Guide
This guide provides a flexible template for crafting powerful Google search queries to find remote job opportunities tailored to your specific roles and desired websites. It also explains how you can automate this search to stay informed about new listings daily.
ðŸš€ Step 1: Craft Your Personalized Job Search Query
The core of this strategy is a highly customizable Google search query. You will modify this template with your own target job roles and a list of job board websites.
Template Structure:
[YOUR_JOB_BOARD_LIST] "[YOUR_PRIMARY_ROLE]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_1]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_2]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_3]" jobs

Part A: Compile Your Job Board List
Start by listing the websites where you want to search for jobs. Use the site: operator before each URL, separated by OR.
Example Job Board List (copy and paste, then add/remove as needed):
site:flexjobs.com OR site:weworkremotely.com OR site:remote.co OR site:virtualvocations.com OR site:workingnomads.com OR site:jobspresso.co OR site:remotive.io OR site:remoteok.com OR site:hubstaff.com OR site:justremote.co OR site:dailyremote.com OR site:pangian.com OR site:nodesk.co OR site:skipthdrive.com OR site:wellfound.com OR site:simplyhired.com OR site:jobs.pitchnhire.com OR site:dice.com OR site:upwork.com OR site:outsourcely.com OR site:toptal.com OR site:guru.com OR site:freelancer.com OR site:remotees.com OR site:remotefreelance.com OR site:remotequrus.com OR site:europeremiely.com OR site:remoteok.io/Europe OR site:remoteok.io/asia OR site:linkedin.com OR site:angel.co OR site:powertofly.com OR site:remotewoman.com OR site:remotehub.io OR site:remoteworkhub.com OR site:remotejobsclub.com OR site:cloudpeeps.com OR site:jobs.wordpress.net OR site:simply-communicate.com/jobs OR site:virtualassistantjobs.com OR site:outsourcingjobs.ph OR site:jobmote.com OR site:remotebaba.com OR site:idealist.org OR site:remotejobr.com OR site:jobscribe.com OR site:remotehunt.com OR site:outsourcinginsight.com OR site:goremote.io OR site:dynamitejobs.co OR site:themuse.com OR site:awesomejobs.io OR site:techjobs.com OR site:jobs.laravel.io OR site:jobsinpods.com OR site:rubynow.com OR site:remoters.net OR site:crossover.com OR site:remotejobs.com OR site:usajobs.gov OR site:governmentjobs.com OR site:careersingovernment.com OR site:federaljobsearch.com OR site:indeed.com OR site:ziprecruiter.com OR site:glassdoor.com

Tips for your list:
 * Add more: Think about niche job boards for your industry, company careers pages (if you have specific targets), or other general aggregators.
 * Remove any: If there are sites you don't want to search, simply delete them from the list.
Part B: Define Your Job Roles (Keywords)
List all the job titles, roles, or specific keywords related to the positions you're seeking. Enclose each phrase in double quotes "" and separate them with OR.
Example Job Role List (replace with your own roles):
"Software Engineer" OR "Developer" OR "Frontend Developer" OR "Backend Developer" OR "Full Stack Engineer" OR "DevOps Engineer" OR "Software Architect" OR "Technical Lead" OR "Web Developer" OR "Mobile Developer" jobs

Tips for your keywords:
 * Be specific: Use exact job titles you'd expect to see.
 * Consider variations: Include common synonyms or related terms (e.g., "Developer" for "Software Engineer").
 * Add skills/technologies (optional): If a specific skill is crucial, you can add it, but be careful not to make the query too long or restrictive (e.g., "Python Developer").
Part C: Combine for Your Full Query
Now, simply paste your compiled Job Board List and your Job Role List together, with a space in between them.
Your Final Query will look something like this:
[YOUR_COMPLETED_JOB_BOARD_LIST_FROM_PART_A] "[YOUR_PRIMARY_ROLE]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_1]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_2]" OR "[YOUR_RELATED_ROLE_3]" jobs

Example (using the examples above):
site:flexjobs.com OR site:weworkremotely.com OR site:remote.co OR site:virtualvocations.com OR site:workingnomads.com OR site:jobspresso.co OR site:remotive.io OR site:remoteok.com OR site:hubstaff.com OR site:justremote.co OR site:dailyremote.com OR site:pangian.com OR site:nodesk.co OR site:skipthdrive.com OR site:wellfound.com OR site:simplyhired.com OR site:jobs.pitchnhire.com OR site:dice.com OR site:upwork.com OR site:outsourcely.com OR site:toptal.com OR site:guru.com OR site:freelancer.com OR site:remotees.com OR site:remotefreelance.com OR site:remotequrus.com OR site:europeremiely.com OR site:remoteok.io/Europe OR site:remoteok.io/asia OR site:linkedin.com OR site:angel.co OR site:powertofly.com OR site:remotewoman.com OR site:remotehub.io OR site:remoteworkhub.com OR site:remotejobsclub.com OR site:cloudpeeps.com OR site:jobs.wordpress.net OR site:simply-communicate.com/jobs OR site:virtualassistantjobs.com OR site:outsourcingjobs.ph OR site:jobmote.com OR site:remotebaba.com OR site:idealist.org OR site:remotejobr.com OR site:jobscribe.com OR site:remotehunt.com OR site:outsourcinginsight.com OR site:goremote.io OR site:dynamitejobs.co OR site:themuse.com OR site:awesomejobs.io OR site:techjobs.com OR site:jobs.laravel.io OR site:jobsinpods.com OR site:rubynow.com OR site:remoters.net OR site:crossover.com OR site:remotejobs.com OR site:usajobs.gov OR site:governmentjobs.com OR site:careersingovernment.com OR site:federaljobsearch.com OR site:indeed.com OR site:ziprecruiter.com OR site:glassdoor.com "Software Engineer" OR "Developer" OR "Frontend Developer" OR "Backend Developer" OR "Full Stack Engineer" OR "DevOps Engineer" OR "Software Architect" OR "Technical Lead" OR "Web Developer" OR "Mobile Developer" jobs

ðŸ”Ž How to Use Your Query Manually:
 * Copy the entire string you've just created.
 * Paste it directly into the Google search bar.
 * Press Enter.
Google will then search all the specified websites for job postings containing any of your defined job role keywords.
ðŸ¤– Automating Your Daily Job Search with Google Alerts
To avoid manually running this query every day, you can set up a free Google Alert. This service monitors the web for new content matching your search terms and sends you a daily email digest.
Setting Up Your Google Alert:
 * Go to Google Alerts.
 * In the "Create an alert about..." box, paste your complete custom search query that you created in Step 1.
 * Click on "Show options" to customize your alert.
 * How often: Select "Once a day" to receive a daily email with new results.
 * Sources: Leave this as "Automatic" for the broadest coverage, or specify if you only want results from certain types of sources (e.g., "Web" or "Blogs").
 * Language: Choose your preferred language.
 * Region: Select "Any Region" or a specific country if your job search is geographically focused.
 * Deliver to: Ensure your email address is selected here.
